Upgrade
==============================================================================


Currently there's no way to upgrade easily from a version to another.
The operation `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE ...` is not supported.

You need to drop and recreate the extension after every upgrade.


Upgrade to version 2.0 and further versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With version 2, the entire core library was rewritten in Rust. This is a major
change that brings new features, better performances and improved stability.

However the changes are mostly internal and for the most part the public
interface of the extension does not change. A masking policy written with
version 1.3 should work with version 2.0 !

!!! warning New RPM repository !

    Version 2.0 is not available on the PGDG RPM repository.
    If you installed PostgreSQL Anonymizer 1.x using the RPM package, you need
    to install the Dalibo Labs repository with the following command:
    `dnf install https://yum.dalibo.org/labs/dalibo-labs-4-1.noarch.rpm`


Upgrade to version 1.3 and further versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with version 1.3, the extension enforces a series of security checks
and it will refuse some masking rules that were previously accepted.

Here's a few example of the changes you may need to make to your masking policy



### Using custom masking functions

If you have developed custom masking functions, you now need to place them
inside a dedicated schema and declare that this schema is `trusted`

For example, let's say you have a function `remove_phone` that delete phone
numbers from a `JSONB` field

First create a schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS my_masks;
```

Then a superuser must declare it as trusted:

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON SCHEMA my_masks IS 'TRUSTED';
```

Now you can write the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_masks.remove_phone(j JSONB)
RETURNS JSONB
AS $$
  SELECT j - ARRAY['phone']
$$
LANGUAGE SQL ;
```

And finally use it in a masking rule:

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN player.personal_details
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION my_masks.remove_phone(personal_details)';
```

See the [Write your own Masks !] section of the doc for more details...

[Write your own Masks !]: masking_functions.md#write-your-own-masks


### Using `pg_catalog` functions


With version 1.3 and later, the `pg_catalog` schema is not longer trusted because
it contains [system administration functions] that should not be used
as masking functions.

[system administration functions]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html

However the extension provides bindings to some useful and safe commodity
functions from the `pg_catalog` schema.

For instance, the following rule

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN employee.phone
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION md5(phone)'
```

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN employee.phone
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.md5(phone)'
```

See the [Using `pg_catalog` functions] section of the doc for more details...

[Using `pg_catalog` functions]: masking_functions.md#Using-pg_catalog-functions

### Operators

The `MASKED WITH FUNCTION` syntax is now more strict and in particular operators
are not allowed as a masking value.

For instance, until version 1.3

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN player.name
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_first_name() || anon.fake_last_name()';
```

Now operators must be replaced by an actual function. For instance, the `||`
operator would be replaced by `anon.concat`

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN player.name
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.concat(anon.fake_first_name(),anon.fake_last_name())';
```

### Conditional masking rules

The `MASKED WITH VALUE CASE WHEN ...` was never an intended feature but it
work by accident.

Until version 1.3, the syntax below was accepted:

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN player.score
  IS 'MASKED WITH VALUE CASE WHEN score IS NULL
                             THEN NULL
                             ELSE anon.random_int_between(0,100)
                             END';
```

The `CASE` syntax is now rejected and can be replaced by the `anon.ternary()`
function:

```sql
SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN player.score
  IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.ternary(score IS NULL,
                                        NULL,
                                        anon.random_int_between(0,100)
  )';
```
