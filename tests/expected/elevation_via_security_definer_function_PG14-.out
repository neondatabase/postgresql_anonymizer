--
-- This test decribes a known elevation attack allowing a masked role to bypass
-- a masking rules and access personal identifiable information (PII)
--
-- THIS IS NOT A SECURITY ISSUE.
-- THIS IS THE EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
--
-- This attack requires
--
-- - a compromise role in the database
-- - CREATE/EXECUTE privilege by default for regular roles, which is considered
--   to be a bad practice since 2018

--
-- How to protect yourself against this ?
--
-- First of all: SECURITY DEFINER is a dangerous option and should be avoided
-- whenever possible
--
-- Second: You should always restrict creating/executing functions by default.
-- This is the default behaviour with PostgreSQL 15 and further. For previous
-- versions it is recommended to REVOKE manually those privileges like this:
--
-- REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
-- REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA foo FROM PUBLIC;
-- REVOKE EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
-- REVOKE EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA foo FROM PUBLIC;
